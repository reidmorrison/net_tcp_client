  # Make Socket calls resilient by adding timeouts, retries and specific
  # exception categories
  #
  # TCP Client with:
  # * Connection Timeouts
  #   Ability to timeout if a connect does not complete within a reasonable time
  #   For example, this can occur when the server is turned off without shutting down
  #   causing clients to hang creating new connections
  #
  # * Automatic retries on startup connection failure
  #   For example, the server is being restarted while the client is starting
  #   Gives the server a few seconds to restart to
  #
  # * Automatic retries on active connection failures
  #   If the server is restarted during
  #
  # Connection and Read Timeouts are fully configurable
  #
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ConnectionTimeout when the connection timeout is exceeded
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ReadTimeout when the read timeout is exceeded
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ConnectionFailure when a network error occurs whilst reading or writing
  #
  # Note: Only the following methods currently have auto-reconnect enabled:
  #  * read
  #  * write
  #
  # Future:
  # * Add auto-reconnect feature to sysread, syswrite, etc...
  # * To be a drop-in replacement to TCPSocket should also need to implement the
  #   following TCPSocket instance methods:  :addr, :peeraddr
  #
  # Design Notes:
  # * Does not inherit from Socket or TCP Socket because the socket instance
  #   has to be completely destroyed and recreated after a connection failure

    #   :connect_timeout [Float]
    #     Time in seconds to timeout when trying to connect to the server
    #     A value of -1 will cause the connect wait time to be infinite
    #     Default: Half of the :read_timeout ( 30 seconds )

    #     Set the logger to which to write log messages to

    #     Whether to use Nagle's Buffering algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle's_algorithm)
    #     Recommend disabling for RPC style invocations where we don't want to wait for an

    #     Number of times to retry when calling #retry_on_connection_failure
    #     This is independent of :connect_retry_count which still applies with

    #     Directly after a connection is established and before it is made available

    #     Typical Use Cases:
    #     - Initialize per connection session sequence numbers
    #     - Pass any authentication information to the server
    #     - Perform a handshake with the server

    #     When multiple servers are supplied using :servers, this option will
    #     determine which server is selected from the list

    #         Select a server in the order supplied in the array, with the first
    #         having the highest priority. The second server will only be connected
    #         to if the first server is unreachable

    #         Randomly select a server from the list every time a connection
    #         is established, including during automatic connection recovery.

    #         FUTURE - Not implemented yet
    #         The server with an IP address that most closely matches the
    #         local ip address will be attempted first
    #         This will result in connections to servers on the localhost
    #         first prior to looking at remote servers

    #         FUTURE - Not implemented yet
    #         The server with the lowest ping time will be selected first

    #         When a Proc is supplied, it will be called passing in the list

    # 2. TCP Socket Connect timeout:
    #    Timed out after 5 seconds trying to connect to the server
    #    Usually means server is busy or the remote server disappeared off the network recently
    #    No retry, just raise a Net::TCPClient::ConnectionTimeout

    # 2. Example of a resilient request that _modifies_ data on the server:
    #
    #    When changing state on the server, for example when updating a value
    #    Wrap _only_ the send with #retry_on_connection_failure
    #    The read must be outside the #retry_on_connection_failure since we must
    #    not retry the send if the connection fails during the #read
    #
    #    value = 45
    #    # Only the send is within the retry block since we cannot re-send once
    #    # the send was successful since the server may have made the change
    #    client.retry_on_connection_failure do
    #      client.send("SETVALUE:#{count}\n")
    #    end
    #    # Server returns "SAVED" if the call was successfull
    #    result = client.read(20).strip
    #
    # Error handling is implemented as follows:
    #    If a network failure occurrs during the block invocation the block
